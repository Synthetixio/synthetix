MODULE DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Havven token contract. Havvens are transferrable ERC20 tokens,
and also give their holders the following privileges.
An owner of havvens is entitled to a share in the fees levied on
nomin transactions, and additionally may participate in nomin
confiscation votes.

After a fee period terminates, the duration and fees collected for that
period are computed, and the next period begins.
Thus an account may only withdraw the fees owed to them for the previous
period, and may only do so once per period.
Any unclaimed fees roll over into the common pot for the next period.

The fee entitlement of a havven holder is proportional to their average
havven balance over the last fee period. This is computed by measuring the
area under the graph of a user's balance over time, and then when fees are
distributed, dividing through by the duration of the fee period.

We need only update fee entitlement on transfer when the havven balances of the sender
and recipient are modified. This is for efficiency, and adds an implicit friction to
trading in the havven market. A havven holder pays for his own recomputation whenever
he wants to change his position, which saves the foundation having to maintain a pot
dedicated to resourcing this.

A hypothetical user's balance history over one fee period, pictorially:

      s ____
       |    |
       |    |___ p
       |____|___|___ __ _  _
       f    t   n

Here, the balance was s between times f and t, at which time a transfer
occurred, updating the balance to p, until n, when the present transfer occurs.
When a new transfer occurs at time n, the balance being p,
we must:

  - Add the area p * (n - t) to the total area recorded so far
  - Update the last transfer time to p

So if this graph represents the entire current fee period,
the average havvens held so far is ((t-f)*s + (n-t)*p) / (n-f).
The complementary computations must be performed for both sender and
recipient.

Note that a transfer keeps global supply of havvens invariant.
The sum of all balances is constant, and unmodified by any transfer.
So the sum of all balances multiplied by the duration of a fee period is also
constant, and this is equivalent to the sum of the area of every user's
time/balance graph. Dividing through by that duration yields back the total
havven supply. So, at the end of a fee period, we really do yield a user's
average share in the havven supply over that period.

A slight wrinkle is introduced if we consider the time r when the fee period
rolls over. Then the previous fee period k-1 is before r, and the current fee
period k is afterwards. If the last transfer took place before r,
but the latest transfer occurred afterwards:

k-1       |        k
      s __|_
       |  | |
       |  | |____ p
       |__|_|____|___ __ _  _
          |
       f  | t    n
          r

In this situation the area (r-f)*s contributes to fee period k-1, while
the area (t-r)*s contributes to fee period k. We will implicitly consider a
zero-value transfer to have occurred at time r. Their fee entitlement for the
previous period will be finalised at the time of their first transfer during the
current fee period, or when they query or withdraw their fee entitlement.

In the implementation, the duration of different fee periods may be slightly irregular,
as the check that they have rolled over occurs only when state-changing havven
operations are performed.
