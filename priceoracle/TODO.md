 - Robustness to failure
 - heartbeat update to the contract every x minutes
 - record last price sent to contract, and send again if price moves by more than some percentage (no more rapid than some speed)
 - volume-weighted median computation
 - graceful handling if it can't get the price from some one of it's sources
