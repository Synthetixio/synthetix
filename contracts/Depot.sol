MODULE DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Depot contract. The Depot provides
a way for users to acquire synths (Synth.sol) and SNX
(Synthetix.sol) by paying ETH and a way for users to acquire SNX
(Synthetix.sol) by paying synths. Users can also deposit their synths
and allow other users to purchase them with ETH. The ETH is sent
to the user who offered their synths for sale.

This smart contract contains a balance of each token, and
allows the owner of the contract (the Synthetix Foundation) to
manage the available balance of synthetix at their discretion, while
users are allowed to deposit and withdraw their own synth deposits
if they have not yet been taken up by another user.

       Conceptually this fits well in an array, but then when users fill an order we
       end up copying the whole array around, so better to use an index mapping instead
       for gas performance reasons.

       The indexes are specified (inclusive, exclusive), so (0, 0) means there's nothing
       in the array, and (3, 6) means there are 3 elements at 3, 4, and 5. You can obtain
       the length of the "array" by querying depositEndIndex - depositStartIndex. All index
       operations use safeAdd, so there is no way to overflow, so that means there is a
       very large but finite amount of deposits this contract can handle before it fills up. */
