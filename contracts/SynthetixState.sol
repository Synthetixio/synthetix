MODULE DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

A contract that holds issuance state and preferred currency of
users in the Synthetix system.

This contract is used side by side with the Synthetix contract
to make it easier to upgrade the contract logic while maintaining
issuance state.

The Synthetix contract is also quite large and on the edge of
being beyond the contract size limit without moving this information
out to another contract.

The first deployed contract would create this state contract,
using it as its store of issuance data.

When a new contract is deployed, it links to the existing
state contract, whose owner would then change its associated
contract to the new one.
