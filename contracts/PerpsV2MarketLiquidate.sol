/*
 * Synthetic PerpsV2
 * =================
 *
 * PerpsV2 markets allow users leveraged exposure to an asset, long or short.
 * A user must post some margin in order to open a perpsV2 account, and profits/losses are
 * continually tallied against this margin. If a user's margin runs out, then their position is closed
 * by a liquidation keeper, which is rewarded with a flat fee extracted from the margin.
 *
 * The Synthetix debt pool is effectively the counterparty to each trade, so if a particular position
 * is in profit, then the debt pool pays by issuing sUSD into their margin account,
 * while if the position makes a loss then the debt pool burns sUSD from the margin, reducing the
 * debt load in the system.
 *
 * As the debt pool underwrites all positions, the debt-inflation risk to the system is proportional to the
 * long-short skew in the market. It is therefore in the interest of the system to reduce the skew.
 * To encourage the minimisation of the skew, each position is charged a funding rate, which increases with
 * the size of the skew. The funding rate is charged continuously, and positions on the heavier side of the
 * market are charged the current funding rate times the notional value of their position, while positions
 * on the lighter side are paid at the same rate to keep their positions open.
 * As the funding rate is the same (but negated) on both sides of the market, there is an excess quantity of
 * funding being charged, which is collected by the debt pool, and serves to reduce the system debt.
 *
 * The contract architecture is as follows:
 *
 *     - FuturesMarketManager.sol:  the manager keeps track of which markets exist, and is the main window between
 *                                  futures and perpsV2 markets and the rest of the system. It accumulates the total debt
 *                                  over all markets, and issues and burns sUSD on each market's behalf.
 *
 *     - PerpsV2MarketSettings.sol: Holds the settings for each market in the global FlexibleStorage instance used
 *                                  by SystemSettings, and provides an interface to modify these values. Other than
 *                                  the base asset, these settings determine the behaviour of each market.
 *                                  See that contract for descriptions of the meanings of each setting.
 *
 * Each market is composed of the following pieces, one of each of this exists per asset:
 *
 *     - ProxyPerpsV2.sol:          The Proxy is the main entry point and visible, permanent address of the market.
 *                                  It acts as a combination of Proxy and Router sending the messages to the
 *                                  appropriate implementation (or fragment) of the Market.
 *                                  Margin is maintained isolated per market. each market is composed of several
 *                                  contracts (or fragments) accessed by this proxy:
 *                                  `base` contains all the common logic and is inherited by other fragments.
 *                                  It's treated as abstract and not deployed alone;
 *                                  `proxyable` is an extension of `base` that implements the proxyable interface
 *                                  and is used as base for fragments that require the messageSender.
 *                                  `mutations` contains the basic market behaviour
 *                                  `views` contains functions to provide visibility to different parameters and
 *                                  is used by external or manager contracts.
 *                                  `delayedOrders` contains the logic to implement the delayed order flows.
 *                                  `offchainDelayedOrders` contains the logic to implement the delayed order
 *                                  with off-chain pricing flows.
 *
 *     - PerpsV2State.sol:          The State contracts holds all the state for the market and is consumed/updated
 *                                  by the fragments.
 *                                  It provides access to the positions in case a migration is needed in the future.
 *
 *     - PerpsV2Market.sol:         Contains the core logic to implement the market and position flows.
 *
 *     - PerpsV2MarketViews.sol:    Contains the logic to access market and positions parameters by external or
 *                                  manager contracts
 *
 *     - PerpsV2MarketDelayedOrdersOffchain.sol: Contains the logic to implement delayed order with off-chain pricing flows
 *
 *
 * Technical note: internal functions within the PerpsV2Market contract assume the following:
 *
 *     - prices passed into them are valid;
 *     - funding has already been recomputed up to the current time (hence unrecorded funding is nil);
 *     - the account being managed was not liquidated in the same transaction;
