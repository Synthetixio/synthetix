/*
 User facing contract for Perps V2 that handles logic related to orders and fees (as opposed to main
 execution logic that's handled by PerpsEngineV2).

 Contract interactions:
 - to PerpsEngineV2: calling mutative operations (transfer and margin changes, trades, manager sUSD operations),
   using market and posistion views
 - to PerpsStorageV2: getting low level market (e.g. baseAsset) and position (e.g. size) details
 - to ExchangeRates: rates
 - to Exchanger: dynamic fees

 User interactions:
 - any user: can manage their own account's positions in any market

 Inheritance:
 - PerpsConfigGettersV2Mixin: calls FlexibleStorage to get configuration values set by manager (PerpsManagerV2)

 Main responsibilities: auth, determining the fee rates (fixed, dynamic, etc), and price deltas,
 convenience methods (e.g. methods that are combinations of other methods), handling and storing temporary order data.

 State & upgradability: can have some short-lived state due to unprocessed async orders (e.g. in next-price mixin).

 Risks: auth, bad execution params (such as fees, rates, price deltas) etc, privileged access to engine.
