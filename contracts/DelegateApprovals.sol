MODULE DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The approval state contract is designed to allow a wallet to
authorise another address to perform actions, on a contract,
on their behalf. This could be an automated service
that would help a wallet claim fees / rewards on their behalf.

The concept is similar to the ERC20 interface where a wallet can
approve an authorised party to spend on the authorising party's
behalf in the allowance interface.

Withdrawing approval deletes the approval for the given delegate.

This contract inherits state for upgradeability / associated
contract.
