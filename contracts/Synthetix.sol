MODULE DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Synthetix token contract. SNX is a transferable ERC20 token,
and also give its holders the following privileges.

== Issuance and Burning ==

All synths issued require a proportional value of SNX to be locked,
where the proportion is governed by the SynthetixState.issuanceRatio. This
means for every $1 of SNX locked up, $(issuanceRatio) synths can be issued.
i.e. to issue 100 synths, 100/issuanceRatio dollars of SNX need to be locked up.

To determine the value of some amount of SNX(S), an oracle is used to push
the price of SNX (P_S) in dollars to the ExchangeRates contract. The value of S
would then be: S * P_S.

Any SNX that are locked up by this issuance process cannot be transferred.
The amount that is locked floats based on the price of SNX. If the price
of SNX moves up, less SNX are locked, so they can be issued against,
or transferred freely. If the price of SNX moves down, more SNX are locked,
even going above the initial wallet balance.

Any synth can be burned to repay the SNX stakers debt. SNX holders can
check their current debt via debtBalanceOf(address) to see the amount
of synths in any value they need to burn to unlock their staked SNX.
