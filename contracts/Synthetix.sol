MODULE DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Synthetix token contract. SNX is a transferable ERC20 token,
and also give its holders the following privileges.
An owner of SNX has the right to issue synths in all synth flavours.

After a fee period terminates, the duration and fees collected for that
period are computed, and the next period begins. Thus an account may only
withdraw the fees owed to them for the previous period, and may only do
so once per period. Any unclaimed fees roll over into the common pot for
the next period.

== Average Balance Calculations ==

The fee entitlement of a synthetix holder is proportional to their average
issued synth balance over the last fee period. This is computed by
measuring the area under the graph of a user's issued synth balance over
time, and then when a new fee period begins, dividing through by the
duration of the fee period.

We need only update values when the balances of an account is modified.
This occurs when issuing or burning for issued synth balances,
and when transferring for synthetix balances. This is for efficiency,
and adds an implicit friction to interacting with SNX.
A synthetix holder pays for his own recomputation whenever he wants to change
his position, which saves the foundation having to maintain a pot dedicated
to resourcing this.

A hypothetical user's balance history over one fee period, pictorially:

      s ____
       |    |
       |    |___ p
       |____|___|___ __ _  _
       f    t   n

Here, the balance was s between times f and t, at which time a transfer
occurred, updating the balance to p, until n, when the present transfer occurs.
When a new transfer occurs at time n, the balance being p,
we must:

  - Add the area p * (n - t) to the total area recorded so far
  - Update the last transfer time to n

So if this graph represents the entire current fee period,
the average SNX held so far is ((t-f)*s + (n-t)*p) / (n-f).
The complementary computations must be performed for both sender and
recipient.

Note that a transfer keeps global supply of SNX invariant.
The sum of all balances is constant, and unmodified by any transfer.
So the sum of all balances multiplied by the duration of a fee period is also
constant, and this is equivalent to the sum of the area of every user's
time/balance graph. Dividing through by that duration yields back the total
synthetix supply. So, at the end of a fee period, we really do yield a user's
average share in the synthetix supply over that period.

A slight wrinkle is introduced if we consider the time r when the fee period
rolls over. Then the previous fee period k-1 is before r, and the current fee
period k is afterwards. If the last transfer took place before r,
but the latest transfer occurred afterwards:

k-1       |        k
      s __|_
       |  | |
       |  | |____ p
       |__|_|____|___ __ _  _
          |
       f  | t    n
          r

In this situation the area (r-f)*s contributes to fee period k-1, while
the area (t-r)*s contributes to fee period k. We will implicitly consider a
zero-value transfer to have occurred at time r. Their fee entitlement for the
previous period will be finalised at the time of their first transfer during the
current fee period, or when they query or withdraw their fee entitlement.

In the implementation, the duration of different fee periods may be slightly irregular,
as the check that they have rolled over occurs only when state-changing synthetix
operations are performed.

== Issuance and Burning ==

In this version of the synthetix contract, synths can only be issued by
those that have been nominated by the synthetix foundation. Synths are assumed
to be valued at $1, as they are a stable unit of account.

All synths issued require a proportional value of SNX to be locked,
where the proportion is governed by the current issuance ratio. This
means for every $1 of SNX locked up, $(issuanceRatio) synths can be issued.
i.e. to issue 100 synths, 100/issuanceRatio dollars of SNX need to be locked up.

To determine the value of some amount of SNX(S), an oracle is used to push
the price of SNX (P_S) in dollars to the contract. The value of S
would then be: S * P_S.

Any SNX that are locked up by this issuance process cannot be transferred.
The amount that is locked floats based on the price of SNX. If the price
of SNX moves up, less SNX are locked, so they can be issued against,
or transferred freely. If the price of SNX moves down, more SNX are locked,
even going above the initial wallet balance.
