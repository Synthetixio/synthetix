MODULE DESCRIPTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------

This contract provides the logic that's used to call tokenFallback()
when transfers happen.

It's pulled out into its own module because it's needed in two
places, so instead of copy/pasting this logic and maininting it
both in Fee Token and Extern State Token, it's here and depended
on by both contracts.

            If we're transferring to a contract and it implements the tokenFallback function, call it.
            This isn't ERC223 compliant because we don't revert if the contract doesn't implement tokenFallback.
            This is because many DEXes and other contracts that expect to work with the standard
            approve / transferFrom workflow don't implement tokenFallback but can still process our tokens as
            usual, so it feels very harsh and likely to cause trouble if we add this restriction after having
            previously gone live with a vanilla ERC20.
