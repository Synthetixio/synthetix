/**
 Contract that implements DelayedOrders (offchain) mechanism for the PerpsV2 market.
 The purpose of the mechanism is to allow reduced fees for trades that commit to next price instead
 of current price. Specifically, this should serve funding rate arbitrageurs, such that funding rate
 arb is profitable for smaller skews. This in turn serves the protocol by reducing the skew, and so
 the risk to the debt pool, and funding rate for traders.
 The fees can be reduced when committing to next price, because front-running (MEV and oracle delay)
 is less of a risk when committing to next price.
 The relative complexity of the mechanism is due to having to enforce the "commitment" to the trade
 without either introducing free (or cheap) optionality to cause cancellations, and without large
 sacrifices to the UX / risk of the traders (e.g. blocking all actions, or penalizing failures too much).
