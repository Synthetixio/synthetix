# havven - fast, stable.

The potential for a stable cryptocurrency and the multitude of use cases it will enable is profound. The utility of the Havven platform is borne by the fiat-denominated token (e.g. the US Dollar), but users will also be incentivised to participate through platform fees. In order to foster an open and transparent approach all Havven code will be open sourced under the MIT OSS License.

## Havven Version 1.0

The initial release of Havven will possess most of the important features of the system:

* A two token system composed of a stablecoin and backing token which can both be traded;
* The stablecoin is backed with a pool of value with which it is convertible;
* The funds to stake the stablecoin are provided by the owners of the backing token;
* Those staking the system are rewarded with fees charged on transactions in the stablecoin;

But it purposely omits others:

* The money supply is centrally constrained, with only the havven foundation being able to expand it;
* Users cannot issue nomins against their havvens, and therefore fee incentive mechanisms are not activated;
* The backing capital cannot be provided by the market, and so the currencyâ€™s ultimate total supply is constrained;

It is critical to the viability of the system that functionality is phased in over time. The initial release will provide a functional stablecoin and the opportunity to collect significant data on the market response. This will ultimately protect the system and those who back as the network scales.
