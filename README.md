# havven - fast, stable.

The potential for a stable cryptocurrency and the multitude of use cases it will enable is profound. The utility of the Havven platform is borne by the fiat-denominated token (e.g. the US Dollar), but users will also be incentivised to participate through platform fees. As transaction volume increases and the stabilisation mechanism is proven at scale, the value of Havven tokens will likely rise. In order to foster an open and transparent approach all Havven code will be open sourced under the MIT OSS License.
