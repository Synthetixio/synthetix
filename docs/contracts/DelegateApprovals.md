# DelegateApprovals

## Description

This contract is used by the [`FeePool`](FeePool.md) to enable users to permit other addresses to withdraw fees for them. In principle it is generic, as the approver just marks a number of delegates as authorised to perform some action on their behalf, with no reference to what that action is.

!!! note
    The file docstring is slightly inaccurate. It says `Withdrawing approval sets the delegate as false instead of removing from the approvals list for auditability.`, but the contract actually uses a nested mapping. That is to say, no explicit approvals list exists and the audit trail is generated by events. So setting `false` and deletion are equivalent operations.
