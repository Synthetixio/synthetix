# Synth

**Old:** Synth.sol: Synth token contract which remits fees on transfers, and directs the Synthetix contract to do exchanges when appropriate.

The original flavours of synth were \<insert synths here\>, and [SIP-5](https://github.com/Synthetixio/SIPs/blob/master/SIPS/sip-5.md) added six new synths sTRX, iTRX, sXTZ, iXTZ, sMKR, iMKR. Crypto synths and their inverses.
