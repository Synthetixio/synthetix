# System Documentation

## Introduction

Synthetix is a decentralised [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/)-based network of synthetic assets called [*Synths*](synths.md). Each Synth is an [ERC20 token](https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard) whose price follows some other asset; for example each [sUSD](https://etherscan.io/token/0x57ab1e02fee23774580c119740129eac7081e9d3) is worth US$1. A wide variety of Synths exists within Synthetix, including fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies, commodities, and [inverse indexes](synths.md#inverse-syths).
In principle the system can support any asset with a price, and provides on-chain exposure to an unlimited range of real-world assets.

Synthetix is otherwise composed of [infrastructure](infrastructure.md) and [a set of incentives](incentives.md) which maintains Synth prices, and is underpinned by the value of the [Synthetix Network Token](synthetix-network-token.md) (SNX). SNX acts as collateral; staking a proportional value of SNX is required to mint Synths. Stakers are rewarded for supporting the system with a pro-rata share of the fees generated by activity in the system. The value of SNX is thus directly connected with the usage of the network it collateralises.

This mechanism allows Synthetix to support instantaneous, near-frictionless conversion between different flavours of Synths without the liquidity and slippage issues experienced by other decentralised exchanges. The resulting network of tokens supports an extensive set of use cases including payments, remittance, eCommerce, trading, loans, wagers, token sales, and many more.

This documentation portal contains a description of how Synthetix operates, to help users understand the system, and to assist developers in building on top of it. A briefer overview is available in the [Synthetix Litepaper](https://www.synthetix.io/uploads/synthetix_litepaper.pdf).

## Get In Touch

* **Chat:** If youâ€™re looking for somewhere to talk with the Synthetix team or with other developers about Synthetix, please visit our [Discord](https://discordapp.com/invite/AEdUHzt) or [/r/synthetix_io](https://reddit.com/r/synthetix_io) on reddit.
* **Read:** For updates, announcements, and information, check out our [Blog](https://blog.synthetix.io/), @twitter:synthetix_io on Twitter, or our [Telegram](https://t.me/havven_news) channel.
* **Email:** Otherwise you can [Contact Us](https://www.synthetix.io/contact-us) by email.

## Developer Resources

* **Code:** Open source repositories are available @synthetixio; the main synthetix repo is @synthetixio/synthetix.
* **Smart Contract API:** Descriptions of all Synthetix smart contracts, their APIs, and a listing of deployed instances can be found in [here](contracts).
* **SynthetixJS:** Synthetix offers a Javascript library which provides a simple interface to communicate with Synthetix contracts. Under the hood this library uses [ethers.js](https://github.com/ethers-io/ethers.js). The source is available @synthetixio/synthetix-js or just `npm i synthetix-js`.
* **GraphQL API:** The system can also be queried through a GraphQL endpoint via [The Graph](https://thegraph.com/explorer/subgraph/synthetixio-team/synthetix); source code available at @synthetixio/synthetix-subgraph.

## Integrations and Dapps

* **Synthetix Dashboard:** Provides an overview of the status of the Synthetix system including price, token supply, exchange volume, fee pool size, open interest, and current collateralisation levels. The dashboard also provides listings of exchanges where [SNX](https://dashboard.synthetix.io/buy-snx) and [sUSD](https://dashboard.synthetix.io/buy-susd) are traded. The dashboard is available at [https://dashboard.synthetix.io](https://dashboard.synthetix.io).
* **Synthetix.exchange:** The [Synthetix Exchange](https://synthetix.exchange) allows users to trade synths, and to buy sUSD with ether. The synthetix exchange has also played host to [trading competitions](https://blog.synthetix.io/synthetix-exchange-trading-competition-v3/) offering SNX prizes to the most successful participants. The source code for the Synthetix Exchange can be found at @synthetixio/synthetix-exchange. A twitter bot that reports statistics for the exchange posts daily at @twitter:SynthXBot.
* **Mintr:** [Mintr](https://mintr.synthetix.io/) is a dApp for SNX holders to participate in the Synthetix Network. Using Mintr, users can mint and burn Synths, monitor their collateralisation levels, buy and sell sUSD through the [Depot](contracts/Depot.md), claim their staking rewards, and vest any SNX they have accrued from the token sale or by staking.
* **UniSwap:** [Uniswap](https://uniswap.io/) is a decentralised exchange for exchanging ETH and ERC20 tokens. Synthetix integrates with it to deepen the Synthetix ecosystem's liquidity, and it acts as an on-ramp/off-ramp for the Synth market. Users who provide liquidity to the [ETH/sETH pool](https://uniswap.exchange/swap/0x42456D7084eacF4083f1140d3229471bbA2949A8) are provided with staking rewards as [part of the Synthetix protocol](https://sips.synthetix.io/sips/sip-8). This is discussed further [here](https://blog.synthetix.io/uniswap-seth-pool-incentives/) and [here](https://blog.synthetix.io/snx-arbitrage-pool/).
* **KyberSwap:** Liquidity is further deepened by the integration of SNX with [KyberSwap](https://kyberswap.com/swap/eth-snx), which is built on the [Kyber Network Protocol](https://kyber.network/). An example use case is described [here](https://blog.synthetix.io/snx-liquidity-has-been-added-to-kyberswap/).

!!! bug
    The Depot description text on Mintr still links to swappr.io, but should link to synthetix.exchange

## Projects Using Synthetix

Apart from Synthetix's own platforms, there are already a number of projects using the Synthetix payment engine for stable crypto payments and other use cases:

* [intimate.io](https://intimate.io/)
* [Deconet](https://payout.team/)
* [Groundhog](https://groundhog.network/)
* [MARKET Protocol](https://marketprotocol.io/)
* [Elysian](https://elycoin.io/)
* [LocalCoinSwap](https://localcoinswap.com/)
* [Media Protocol](https://medium.com/@mediaprotocolsm)
* [ARAW](https://arawtoken.io/)

As the [DeFi network](https://defi.network/) gains more traction we only expect this set of projects to expand.

!!! caution "?"
    Media Protocol looks dead. Should this be removed?

!!! todo
    Add logos for each of these projects and change to a grid layout with cards.

    Flesh this out.
