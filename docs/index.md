# Introduction

Synthetix is a decentralised [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/)-based network of *synthetix assets*. Each of these assets, called [Synths](synths.md), is an [ERC20 token](https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard) whose price is the same as that of another asset, for example each [sUSD](https://etherscan.io/token/0x57ab1e02fee23774580c119740129eac7081e9d3) is worth US$1. A wide variety of synthetic assets exist within Synthetix, including fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies and commodities, and [inverse indexes](synths.md#inverse-syths). In principle the system can support any asset with a price.
The Synthetix system is otherwise composed of [a token](synthetix-network-token.md), [infrastructure](infrastructure.md), and [a set of incentives](incentives.md) which allow these prices to be maintained.

Synthetix supports instant, near-frictionless conversion between different flavours of Synths. The resulting network of tokens supports a variety of use cases including payments, remittance, eCommerce, trading, loans, wagers, token sales, and many more.
This set of documentation contains a description of how Synthetix operates, to allow software developers to build powerful products on top of the Synthetix system.
