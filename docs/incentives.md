## Liquidity Providers

Liquidity providers are incentivised to arb the [sETH/ETH UniSwap Liquidity Pool](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe9cf7887b93150d4f2da7dfc6d502b216438f244/#tokentxns). It is important that the prices of [sETH](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5e74c9036fb86bd7ecdcb084a0673efc32ea31cb) and ETH are close, so that the UniSwap pool can act as a low-friction on/off-ramp for [synthetix.exchange](https://etherscan.io/address/0x5e74c9036fb86bd7ecdcb084a0673efc32ea31cb).  This pool is assigned 5% of the inflationary supply, currently $72,000$ SNX per week. For further details, see the discussion on [liquidity provider incentives](../incentives.md#liquidity-providers).
