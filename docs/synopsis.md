# System Synopsis

Synthetix is a decentralised [Ethereum](https://www.ethereum.org/)-based network of synthetic assets called [*synths*](tokens.md#synths). Each synth is an [ERC20 token](https://theethereum.wiki/w/index.php/ERC20_Token_Standard) whose price tracks some other asset; for example each [sUSD](https://etherscan.io/token/0x57ab1e02fee23774580c119740129eac7081e9d3) token is worth US$1. A wide variety of Synths exists within Synthetix, including fiat currencies, cryptocurrencies, commodities, and [inverse indexes](tokens.md#inverse-syths).
In principle the system can support any asset with a price, and provides on-chain exposure to an unlimited range of real-world assets.

Synthetix is otherwise composed of [a smart contract infrastructure](contracts/index.md) and [a set of incentives](incentives.md) which maintains Synth prices. It is underpinned by the value of the [Synthetix Network Token](tokens.md#synthetix-network-token) (SNX). SNX acts as collateral; staking a proportional value of SNX is required to mint Synths. Stakers are rewarded for supporting the system with a pro-rata share of the fees generated by activity in the system. The value of SNX is thus directly connected with the usage of the network it collateralises.

This mechanism allows Synthetix to support instantaneous, near-frictionless conversion between different flavours of Synths without the liquidity and slippage issues experienced by other decentralised exchanges. The resulting network of tokens supports an extensive set of use cases including payments, remittance, eCommerce, trading, loans, wagers, token sales, and many more.

A briefer overview of the system than is contained in this documentation is available in the [Synthetix Litepaper](https://www.synthetix.io/uploads/synthetix_litepaper.pdf), and the explainers on [staking rewards](https://www.synthetix.io/stakingrewards), [synthetix.exchange](https://www.synthetix.io/products/exchange), and [mintr](https://www.synthetix.io/products/mintr). A snapshot of the current system status is always live at [dashboard.synthetix.io](https://dashboard.synthetix.io/).
